## 🧠 About Me

I'm currently a Computer Science student at **Hilcoe**, and I love building projects that solve real problems or help me learn something new. My strengths lie in backend development, graphic design, and UI/UX thinking.

Whether it's a REST API or a quick game prototype, I'm always working to improve and push my limits.
